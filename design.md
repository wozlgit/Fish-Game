# Evolution
- Improved senses (Lateral line sense/Electric sense) (can see sharks hidden in plantation easier; this could lower the fun of the game; or maybe make it so 
  even with very high levels of this (if there will be multiple levels), the player still can't see threats very well; this could make it so getting this is
  a requirement to go to higher difficulty areas)
- Defense mechanisms:
    - Poison cloud
    - Smoke bomb
    - Dodge/thrusters
